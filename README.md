iSchool Web App, a web application promoting RIT's School of Information

* Employed a variety of UI components and RESTful services to construct an attractive and informative front-end web
presence for the School of Information.

- Several of my components are functional and stateful where heavy uses of React Hooks (useState, useEffect) were involved
- I use UI components from AntDesign, Reactstrap, React Bootstrap, Framer Motion, Semantic UI, and Material UI
