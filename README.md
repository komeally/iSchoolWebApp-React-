Things I did that were above and beyond:
- Several of my components are functional and stateful where heavy uses of React Hooks (useState, useEffect) were involved
- I use UI components from AntDesign, Reactstrap, React Bootstrap, Framer Motion, Semantic UI, and Material UI 
- In my graduate accordion I use both Reactstrap and React Bootstrap
- Within people, I noticed an inconsistency with the Twitter links, so I addressed this (I found a similar one with emails but ran out of time)
